# Custom_printf
This project implements a custom version of the printf() function in C without using the stdio.h or stdarg.h libraries. Instead, the code manually manages variable-length arguments (variadic functions) and provides custom implementations of basic input/output functions like putchar and puts, using low-level system calls.
